# GoDaddy API Map — Live Capture + Documented-API Reconciliation

Captured 2026-05-28 via CDP from an authenticated `account.godaddy.com` session, plus reconciliation
against GoDaddy's 12 published developer APIs.

## Two surfaces

GoDaddy exposes **two distinct surfaces**:

1. **Public developer API** (`api.godaddy.com`, sandbox `api.ote-godaddy.com`) — the 12 documented APIs.
   This is what `godaddy-pp-cli` wraps. Authoritative source = GoDaddy's published OpenAPI specs.
2. **Internal account-UI API** (`account.godaddy.com` etc.) — what the GoDaddy dashboard calls. Captured
   live below as the "manual map" / cherries. Not part of the public CLI surface but useful supplement.

## Documented-API coverage reconciliation (the CLI vs the 12)

| Documented API | CLI command present? |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Abuse | YES (`abuse`) |
| Aftermarket | YES (`aftermarket`) |
| Agreements | GAP — no `agreements` command |
| ANS (name servers) | GAP — no `ans` command |
| Auctions | PARTIAL — likely under `aftermarket`; no dedicated `auctions` |
| Certificates | YES (`certificates`) |
| Countries | YES (`countries`) |
| Domains | YES (`domains`, incl. DNS records) |
| Orders | YES (`orders`) |
| Parking | YES (`parking`) |
| Shoppers | YES (`shoppers`) |
| Subscriptions | YES (`subscriptions`) |

CLI also ships `agents`, `analytics`, `customers`, `profile`, `promoted`, `search` resources.
**Coverage: ~9-10 of 12 documented APIs.** Candidate additions: Agreements, ANS, dedicated Auctions
(niche; confirm against current developer.godaddy.com specs before adding).

```

These are `account.godaddy.com` / `cart.godaddy.com` / `notifications-api.godaddy.com` internal endpoints
(product list, billing, notifications, cart). Supplementary to the public-API CLI surface.

## Reproduction
CDP: `session.use(<account target>)`, `Network.enable`, subscribe `requestWillBeSent`, reload
`account.godaddy.com/products`. Public-API specs: developer.godaddy.com/doc (per-API OpenAPI).
