# Cal.com — Printing Press CLI

cal-com-pp-cli wraps the entire Cal.com v2 API and adds a local SQLite store of your bookings, event types, schedules, and team data. Composed intents like `book` and `reschedule next` collapse multi-call dances into one transactional command. Local-store analytics, conflict detection, and team workload land in milliseconds with no API call.

## When to Use This CLI

Reach for cal-com-pp-cli whenever an agent needs to read or mutate a Cal.com calendar without burning context on the multi-call dance the API requires for booking and rescheduling. The local store makes 'what's on my calendar', 'when am I free', 'who is overloaded', and 'where are my conflicts' near-instant offline answers. The composed `book` and `reschedule next` commands are the right tools for transactional bookings; the endpoint-mirror coverage is there for everything else.

## Unique Capabilities

These capabilities aren't available in any other tool for this API.

### Composed booking flows
- **`book`** — Find a slot and create a booking in one composed command — slot check, optional reservation, create, optional confirm.

  _Reach for this whenever you need to book a meeting; one call replaces four and is safe to dry-run._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli book --event-type-id 96531 --start 2026-05-06T17:00:00Z --attendee-name Guest --attendee-email guest@example.com --dry-run
  ```
- **`slots find`** — Find first available slots across multiple event-type IDs in one call, ranked by start time.

  _Use this when you don't know which event type fits — let the caller pick from a ranked merged list._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli slots find --event-type-ids 96531 --start tomorrow --end "tomorrow 23:59" --json
  ```
- **`reschedule next`** — Move an existing booking to the next available slot for the same event type, after a cutoff.

  _Use this for last-minute bumps — one command instead of three, with dry-run safety._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli reschedule next --uid <booking-uid> --after tomorrow --dry-run
  ```

### Local state that compounds
- **`agenda`** — Upcoming bookings in a window — today, this week, or any duration — read from the local store.

  _Use this whenever an agent needs 'what's on my calendar'; single command across any time window._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli agenda --window today --json --select id,start,title,attendees
  ```
- **`analytics no-show`** — No-show, cancellation, volume, and density metrics over a window. Sister subcommands under analytics: bookings (volume), cancellations, no-show, density. --by accepts event-type, attendee, or weekday on the rate commands; analytics density --unit hour adds hourly heatmaps.

  _Use this for capacity planning, no-show trend analysis, or attendee follow-up — answers no single API call provides._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli analytics no-show --window 90d --by attendee --json
  ```
- **`conflicts`** — Detects overlapping bookings within a time window — pairs whose time ranges intersect get reported. Reads the local store, no API call.

  _Run before sending confirmations or after a bulk reschedule — surfaces double-bookings the API silently allows._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli conflicts --window 7d --json
  ```
- **`gaps`** — Finds open windows in your schedule that are available but unbooked, filtered by minimum block size.

  _Use this for capacity planning — answers 'when can I take a meeting' rather than 'what's on my plate'._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli gaps --window 7d --min-minutes 60 --json
  ```
- **`workload`** — Booking distribution across team members over a window — surfaces overloaded vs underutilized hosts.

  _Use this for round-robin tuning or to spot host burnout before it shows up as no-shows._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli workload --team-id 42 --window 30d --json
  ```
- **`event-types stale`** — Event types with zero bookings in the last N days — candidates for removal.

  _Use this for quarterly cleanup — keeps your bookable surface from drifting._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli event-types stale --days 90 --json
  ```

### Host control surface
- **`link create`** — Create a new bookable link (event type) on your Cal.com account; prints the cal.com/<your-username>/<slug> URL ready to share.

  _The host's primary creative act. Bookable links are how attendees book time; this is the command to make one._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli link create --slug 30min --length 30 --title "30 Min Meeting"
  ```
- **`link list`** — List every bookable link you own with the full URL pre-rendered for copy-share.

  _Use this to see what links you have and grab their URLs without hand-composing cal.com/<user>/<slug>._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli link list --json
  ```
- **`ooo set`** — Mark yourself out-of-office for a date range so Cal.com excludes the period from slot search.

  _Going on vacation? Sick? Run this once and stop getting booked. Optional --redirect-to-user forwards bookings to a teammate (round-robin only)._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli ooo set --start 2026-05-12 --end 2026-05-18 --reason vacation --notes "Hawaii trip"
  ```
- **`ooo list`** — List your active and upcoming OOO entries.

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli ooo list --json
  ```

### Agent-native plumbing
- **`webhooks coverage`** — Audits registered webhook triggers against the canonical set and reports lifecycle events with no subscriber.

  _Run this whenever you add a new automation — surfaces missed triggers like BOOKING_NO_SHOW_UPDATED before they bite._

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli webhooks coverage --json
  ```

### Finding the right command

When you know what you want to do but not which command does it, ask the CLI directly:

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli which "<capability in your own words>"
```

`which` resolves a natural-language capability query to the best matching command from this CLI's curated feature index. Exit code `0` means at least one match; exit code `2` means no confident match — fall back to `--help` or use a narrower query.

## Recipes


### Create a bookable link and share its URL

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli link create --slug 30min --length 30 --title "30 Min Meeting"
cal-com-pp-cli link list --json --select links.slug,links.bookable_url
```

`link create` returns the bookable URL pre-rendered (cal.com/<your-username>/<slug>); `link list` is the host's view of every link they've published.

### Mark yourself out-of-office

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli ooo set --start 2026-05-12 --end 2026-05-18 --reason vacation --notes "Hawaii trip"
cal-com-pp-cli ooo list --json
```

While the OOO entry is active, Cal.com excludes the range from slot search so you don't get booked.

### Today's agenda from the local store

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli agenda --window today --json --select bookings.uid,bookings.title,bookings.start,bookings.attendees
```

Returns just the four fields an agent needs from the agenda envelope — keeps context tight against deeply-nested booking payloads.

### Cross-event-type slot search ranked by start

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli slots find --event-type-ids 96531 --start tomorrow --end "tomorrow 23:59" --json --first-only
```

Fans out /v2/slots per event-type ID; returns only the earliest slot.

### No-show rate by attendee for capacity planning

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli analytics no-show --window 90d --by attendee --json
```

Local SQL aggregation over synced bookings; no API call.

### Audit webhook coverage before adding automation

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli webhooks coverage --json
```

Compares your registered triggers against the canonical Cal.com lifecycle set and surfaces missing subscribers.

### Reschedule a booking to the next free slot

```bash
cal-com-pp-cli reschedule next --uid <booking-uid> --after tomorrow --dry-run
```

One composed command replaces three; --dry-run prints the planned move without committing.

## Auth Setup

Cal.com uses bearer tokens prefixed with `cal_live_` (live) or `cal_test_` (test). Set `CAL_COM_TOKEN` in your environment, or run `auth set-token` once. The CLI also accepts managed-user access tokens and OAuth access tokens through the same Authorization header. Per-resource API-version pinning via `cal-api-version` is handled automatically by the client.

Run `cal-com-pp-cli doctor` to verify setup.

## Agent Mode

Add `--agent` to any command. Expands to: `--json --compact --no-input --no-color --yes`.

- **Pipeable** — JSON on stdout, errors on stderr
- **Filterable** — `--select` keeps a subset of fields. Dotted paths descend into nested structures; arrays traverse element-wise. Critical for keeping context small on verbose APIs:

  ```bash
  cal-com-pp-cli bookings get --agent --select id,name,status
  ```
- **Previewable** — `--dry-run` shows the request without sending
- **Offline-friendly** — sync/search commands can use the local SQLite store when available
- **Non-interactive** — never prompts, every input is a flag

### Response envelope

Commands that read from the local store or the API wrap output in a provenance envelope:

```json
{
  "meta": {"source": "live" | "local", "synced_at": "...", "reason": "..."},
  "results": <data>
}
```

Parse `.results` for data and `.meta.source` to know whether it's live or local. A human-readable `N results (live)` summary is printed to stderr only when stdout is a terminal — piped/agent consumers get pure JSON on stdout.

## Agent Feedback

When you (or the agent) notice something off about this CLI, record it:

```
cal-com-pp-cli feedback "the --since flag is inclusive but docs say exclusive"
cal-com-pp-cli feedback --stdin < notes.txt
cal-com-pp-cli feedback list --json --limit 10
```

Entries are stored locally at `~/.cal-com-pp-cli/feedback.jsonl`. They are never POSTed unless `CAL_COM_FEEDBACK_ENDPOINT` is set AND either `--send` is passed or `CAL_COM_FEEDBACK_AUTO_SEND=true`. Default behavior is local-only.

Write what *surprised* you, not a bug report. Short, specific, one line: that is the part that compounds.

## Output Delivery

Every command accepts `--deliver <sink>`. The output goes to the named sink in addition to (or instead of) stdout, so agents can route command results without hand-piping. Three sinks are supported:

| Sink | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `stdout` | Default; write to stdout only |
| `file:<path>` | Atomically write output to `<path>` (tmp + rename) |
| `webhook:<url>` | POST the output body to the URL (`application/json` or `application/x-ndjson` when `--compact`) |

Unknown schemes are refused with a structured error naming the supported set. Webhook failures return non-zero and log the URL + HTTP status on stderr.

## Named Profiles

A profile is a saved set of flag values, reused across invocations. Use it when a scheduled agent calls the same command every run with the same configuration - HeyGen's "Beacon" pattern.

```
cal-com-pp-cli profile save briefing --json
cal-com-pp-cli --profile briefing bookings get
cal-com-pp-cli profile list --json
cal-com-pp-cli profile show briefing
cal-com-pp-cli profile delete briefing --yes
```

Explicit flags always win over profile values; profile values win over defaults. `agent-context` lists all available profiles under `available_profiles` so introspecting agents discover them at runtime.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Usage error (wrong arguments) |
| 3 | Resource not found |
| 4 | Authentication required |
| 5 | API error (upstream issue) |
| 7 | Rate limited (wait and retry) |
| 10 | Config error |

## Argument Parsing
